# This repository is my solution to the Elovio Data Science challenge

# In this repository, I apply LDA, one of the Topic Modeling models, on the given dataset 'Eluvio_DS_Challenge.csv' to discover topics related to some given entities. For example, I extract from the dataset all records related to 'Middle East' as an entity using a list of related keywords ['egypt', 'palestine', 'israel', 'iraq', 'iran', 'arab', 'saudi', 'gaza', 'turk']. Then I train different LDA models on the extracted dataset and discover all topics embedded within it.

# The notebook Topic_Modeling.ipynb explains all the steps performed starting from cleaning and preprocessing the data, till visualizing the discovered topics and drawing conclusions.
